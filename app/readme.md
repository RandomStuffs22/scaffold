# Your application
### Better documentation is available at http://docs.scaffold.im.

This is where you'll build your app with Scaffold.

## Folder structure

Entirely up to you, but it's handy to keep things separated in their
own folder. We've set up routes, config, helpers, and models (helpers
and models have to stay using that name), but you can rename/move
everything else within it. Scaffold's flexible.

## Renaming "app"

You can change the name of the "app" folder completely. It'll help a
bit with security and - well - if you really want to, you don't need
persauding. All you need to do is:

1. Rename the folder. (Obviously)
2. Change "app" to whatever you named the folder in the main index.php file.
