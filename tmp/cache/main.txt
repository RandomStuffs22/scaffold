What you&rsquo;re looking at (that's me) is the default controller.<\/p>\n<p>You'll find me hanging around <code>app\/controllers\/main.php<\/code>, and the view (that's the fancy HTML outputting bit) is in <code>app\/views\/main.php<\/code>.<\/p>\n\n<h2>New here?<\/h2>\n<p>You'll probably want to read <a href=\"http:\/\/learn.scaffold.im\">the documentation<\/a> through first. Although Scaffold's pretty easy to pick up, looking at a codebase can be pretty overwhelming the first time. You'll also want to know Scaffold's hidden tips and tricks as well, no doubt.<\/p>\n        \n        <small>Rendered in 0.0081 seconds, powered by Scaffold version 0.1. 0 database queries were harmed in the making of this page.<\/small>\n    <\/body>\n<\/html>","profile":"main","modified":1349958219}
